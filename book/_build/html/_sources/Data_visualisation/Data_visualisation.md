# Data Visualisation
## When should I visualise my data?

All of the time! 
At any point in a project, visualising your data and results is massively important!

* At the start of a project, data visualisation helps you to understand your data, see trends and spot outliers.
* During a project you will probably have to discuss your work with supervisors, collaborators, and peers, and diagrams make this much easier.
* When you're ready to present or write up what you've done, if you've made diagrams as you went you will already have lots of ready to go.

I think that making plots and diagrams is particularly important when you are working on a computational project.
When working computationally, you can go many days without feeling like you've made tangible progress.
Making a diagram to describe an aspect of your work can help to combat this feeling, and helps you prove to yourself that you *have* made progress!
This diagram doesn't have to be complicated; for example you could just make a flowchart to describe the pipeline you've spent days reading up on, planning and installing.
