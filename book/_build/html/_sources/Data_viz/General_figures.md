# General Resources

Some more online figure making resources.

* [Biorender](https://biorender.com/)

    If you need to make a figure to describe the biology behind your work or a potential mechanism, Biorender is a great resource - much easier than messing about in excel for hours!
    You'll need a license to use the figures in publications or download figures in the highest quality, so this worth mentioning to your supervisor or manager.

* [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/index.html)

    For making flowcharts to describe your pipelines.

* [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)

    Not necessarily work related... but if you want a break and fancy looking at some cool uses of data vis, check The Pudding out.
