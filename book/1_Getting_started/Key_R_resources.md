# Useful R Resources

R is a really popular language, particularly for working with data in biology, so there are loads of packages and tutorials out there.

It's also generally more popular with women and other marginalised genders due to the strong, diverse community. See [R-ladies](https://rladies.org/) - the name needs work, but it's a super friendly community for anyone who isn't a cis man, whether you're looking for troubleshooting, a job or just some fun coding. :smile:

R can be run in RStudio, an integrated development environment. So basically, instead of typing straight into the terminal like this:

```{figure} ../assets/images/Terminal_example.png
---
name: Terminal_example
alt: A screenshot of the terminal, with R open
width: 500px
---
```

You get a nice friendly set up like this:

```{figure} ../assets/images/RStudio_example.png
---
name: R_studio
alt: A screenshot of Rstudio
---
```

One of my fave things RStudio can do is rename in scope. This is a neat little trick which changes all occurrences of a given variable name at once.

```{figure} ../assets/images/rename_in_scope.gif
---
name: Rename_in_scope
alt:  A gif showing how to rename in scope
width: 400px
---
```

You can also record all of your analyses in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) files - a lot like this file you're reading right now, which is a markdown file. DO THIS. If you don't keep a well annotated record of your work either:

1. You will forget what you've done, and have a rubbish time trying to write up.
2. You will forget where you got your data, and have a rubbish time trying to write up.
3. In 6 - 18 months your supervisor will contact you and ask a random question about the analysis that is key to the work being published and you'll lose a week rerunning the analysis because you have no idea what you did and you will hate them, yourself, and science as a whole.

So what I'm saying is record everything properly in Rmarkdown documents, and your future self will love you.

## [Introduction to R](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intro/index.html)

Ongoing (as of 2020) WFH course run by the Bioinformatics Core at CRUK Cambridge Institute. Looks like a good, relevant introduction to R, RStudio, data manipulation and plots. You can’t access their video chat but all materials and solutions are available.

## [R Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

Not every package has a cheatsheet, but key packages like dpylr and ggplot2 do, as well as some more niche packages. Super useful!

## [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)

A fantastic project aimed at teaching researchers fundamental data skills. Lots of resources! The [intro to R page](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) would be a good place to start.

## [Hands-On programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

Website for the book Hands-On programming with R.

## [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Website for the book R for Data Science.

## [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/)

Website for the book Computational Genomics with R.

## [r-statistics](http://r-statistics.co/)

A great site aimed at people working on machine learning and stats in R. Also has some great ggplot2 information.

## [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

If you can’t work out how to do something, lots of other people have definitely also had the same issue, so don’t spend ages trying to work it out from scratch. Google and Stackoverflow – LOTS of programming community questions and answers - are your friends.

## [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/)

As you move more into the biological aspects of your analysis, Biostars is the equivalent of Stackoverflow for your questions. How to get raw data, what a certain option in a program means – lots of community info here! Also feel free to ask your own questions, but do your own research first - this is a community of people helping each other for free.
