# Visual Studio Code Extensions

Visual Studio Code is a free open-source code editor that I like to use when working in markdown or Python. It's easy to customise your workspace set up via extensions, so here is a list of my favourite VS Code extensions:

* [Rainbow Brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets) - Highlights open and closing brackets in a rainbow of colours - great for finding that missing bracket in your code! ðŸŒˆ
* [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) - Highlights indentations in a rainbow of colours - great for spotting indentation problems. ðŸŒˆ
* [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) - changes the default file icons to material icons. This makes navigating around files easier for me.
* [Markdown Emoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-emoji) - clearly a very important feature to have... ðŸ˜‰
* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - A extension that adds rules for markdown files, and highlights violations of these rules. I find it helpful to keep my markdown documents neat and consistent.
  
## Colour themes

Customise your GUI to make the colour scheme kinder to your eyes.

* [In Bed By 7pm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.inbedby7pm) - my current favourite theme.
* [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula)
* [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)
