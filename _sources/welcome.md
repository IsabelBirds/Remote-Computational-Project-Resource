# Welcome

I created this resource during the COVID-19 pandemic to support students transferred from wet to remote dry lab projects at short notice.

There are a wealth of excellent tutorials on coding and computational analyses out there. This is great, but can also be very intimidating to a beginner. Working remotely also means that students may miss out on hearing about useful resources that would come up in conversation, and may struggle with problems for longer before asking for help.

I have tried to collect links to:

* General tutorials for the complete beginner.
* Tutorials for specific analyses or pipelines.
* Free online textbooks.
* Places to ask for help.

I have also tried to highlight some aspects of computational work that aren't immediately obvious, such as how to ask for help effectively, and what to think about when finding data.
## Contributing

This resource has evolved around information I need to share with students I am mentoring, and my own likes, dislikes and expertise.
It is by no means comprehensive but I hope it is helpful.
Contributions to improve it or add content are always welcome.

Please note that I have not checked the content or sources of every resource included in this site in detail.
Equal, supportive and inclusive research is very important to me - if I have included any content/reference anyone that does not align with this just let me know and it will be removed.
