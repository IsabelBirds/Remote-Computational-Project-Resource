# Remote Computational Project Resource

Collection of resources for delivering remote research projects.
Started during COVID-19, to help wet lab masters students quickly transferred to remote dry lab.

*I am currently using this project to learn how to create Jupyter books, so a lot of the content is getting rewritten and rearranged.*
