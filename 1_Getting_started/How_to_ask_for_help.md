# How to ask for help effectively

A common issue for people new to coding is that they don't know how to ask for help effectively. This leads to a long confusing chain of email which is frustrating for all involved - the demonstrator doesn't know what the problem actually is, and the student is stuck waiting with their problem unsolved.

So when you email to ask fo help, make sure you tell us:

## What youâ€™re trying to do

When you're midway through a project and it's all you're thinking about, it might seem odd to think that your demonstrator has forgotten the exact details of what you're doing - after all, you chat every week. However, they're probably working on lots of different things, and they feel the same way about their own project, so a reminder of what you're working on always appreciated!

## The code you're trying to run

Send the document with your code in, and give us details! Did you write it all yourself? Is it based on someone else's code? Is it based on information from a manual for some software. This is really important - it could be as simple as you have a bracket in the wrong place, or misnamed variable - we've all been there, but we can't help you spot this if you don't share your code!

## The error message you're getting

This is key!

## Explain how you've tried to fix it so far

How have you tried to solve it so far? Why do you think these things didn't work?

When you googled your error code, did anything helpful show up? Were there any web pages that discuss the issue that you didn't quite understand? The key thing here is that demonstrators are not google - everyone who codes has to look up error messages all of the time, show us that you've had a go.

## Include some data

This will depend on the question, but it can also be helpful to include the data you're working on, a link to the data, or a smaller example data set.
